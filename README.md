### What I learned

I always try to use simple tools for my projects but in this case Vanilla Javascript #javascript came short of my expectations so I had to rebuild the whole project with React JS #reactjs which caused me time.

The issue was I couldn't find a way to add click listeners to dynamically added HTML #html elements added to the DOM with this method "insertAdjacentHTML".
